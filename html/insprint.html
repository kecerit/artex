<h1>Instructions of the Art Exhibition Game</h1>

      <p>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        You just became part of a community of 9 painters (including you).
        The community will collectively decide which paintings can be 
        displayed in <strong>3 (three)</strong> artistic exhibitions (named A, B, and C).
        The three exhibitions have all the same value for the members of the community.
      </p>
       
      <p>
      Always keep in mind: In this game you will act both as an <em>artist</em> and as an <em>art critic</em>. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <h3>The game</h3>
      
      The game is divided in rounds, and each round is divided in three steps:
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Each player creates 1 (one) painting, and chooses 1 (one) exhibition to which he / she submits the work of art.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 2: </strong>Each player reviews 3 (three) of the 8 (eight) paintings produced by the other artists. 
          The review is done by assigning a rating on a scale from 0 (zero) to 10 (ten). 
          
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 3: </strong>All the paintings that received an average review-score
           greater than <em>5 (five)</em> are put on display in the exhibition to which they were 
          submitted. If your painting is displayed you will receive a <em>payoff</em>.
          </li>
      </ul>
      
      </p>
      
      <p>
      <h3>Who reviews what</h3>
      
        <ul>
          <li>When you choose one exhibition, you increase your chances to become a reviewer for that exhibition in the <strong>next</strong> round.</li>
          <li>If your painting is also published, your chances will be even higher.</li>
          <li>You will always review 3 paintings, and you can never review your own painting.</li>
        </ul>
        
      </p>
      
       <p>
      <h3>Payoff calculation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You will receive a fixed monetary compensation of <strong>10 (ten) CHF</strong>, plus 
            a variable amount based on your performance in the game.</li>
        <li>If one of your painting is published you will receive a sum equal to <strong>(3 / N) CHF</strong>, where N is the number of artists who published with you in the <strong>same</strong> exhibition.
