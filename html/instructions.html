				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				You just became part of a community of 9 painters (including you).
			  The goal of the community is to collectively decide which paintings can be 
				exposed in <strong>3 (three)</strong> artistic exhibitions (named A, B, or C).
	      The three exhibitions have all the same value for the players.
     	</p>
			 
			<p>
			Remember: In this game you will act both as an <em>artist</em> and as an <em>art critic</em>. 
      </p>

			<h3>The game</h3>
			
			The game is divided in rounds, and each round is divided in three steps:
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Each player produces 1 (one) painting, and submits it to one of three exhibitions.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Step 2: </strong>Each player reviews 3 (three) of the 8 (eight) paintings produced by the other artists. 
				  The review is done by assigning a rating on a scale from 1 (one)to 9 (nine) to each painting. 
					Self review is not allowed.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Step 3: </strong>All the paintings that received an average review-score
					 greater than 7 (seven) are put on display in the exhibition to which they were 
					submitted.
					</li>
			</ul>
			
			</p>
