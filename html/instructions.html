			You just became part of a community of 9 painters (including you).
		  The goal of the community is to collectively decide which paintings can be 
			exposed in <strong>3 (three)</strong> artistic exhibitions.
     	</p>
			 
			<p>
			The game is divided in rounds, and in each of these you will act both as an
			<em>artist</em> and as an <em>art critic</em>. 
      </p>
			
			<p>
			Each round is divided in three steps, as follows:
			
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Each player produces 1 (one) painting, and submits it to one of three exhibitions (named A, B, or C).
				  All the three exhibitions are equally prestigious to the players.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Step 2: </strong>Each player reviews 3 (three) of the 8 (eight) paintings produced by the other artists. 
				  The review is done by assigning a rating on a scale from 1 to 9 to the painting. 
					Self review is not allowed.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Step 3: </strong>All the paintings that received an average review 
					score greater than 7 (seven) are put on display in the exhibition to which they were 
					submitted.
					</li>
			</ul>
			
			</p>
			
			<p>
			For each paining that is put on display in one of the exhibitions you will 
			receive <strong>0.XX CHF</strong>.
			</p>
			
			The game will ends after <strong>50 (fifty)</strong> rounds, or after 1 hour.
