      <p>
        The experiment is divided in two
        parts: <strong>Preparation</strong> and <strong>Game</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Part 1: Preparation</h3>

        In Part 1 you will <strong>not</strong> interact with other players,
        and you <em>cannot</em> earn points unless explicitly
        mentioned on the screen. Part 1 involves three steps:

        <ul>
          <li>
            First, some basic <strong>psychological and
            demographics</strong> characteristics will be collected.
          </li>
          <li>
            Secondly, the <strong>instructions</strong> of the game
            played in Part 2 will be shown to you, followed by a short
            understanding <strong>quiz</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, you will play in <strong>practice mode</strong>
            to get familiar with the game interface.
          </li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <p>
        <h3>Part 2: Game</h3>

        In this part you will interact with <strong>other
        human</strong> participants. You might need to wait a short
        while until enough participants are connected.

        <ul>
          <li>
            The game will be repeated for a certain number
            of <strong>rounds</strong>, and in each round you will
            have a chance to <strong>earn points</strong> based on
            your actions, and the actions of other players.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the game, you will be shown
            a <strong>questionnaire</strong> consisting in a short
            compulsory part, followed by a series of optional
            questions.
          </li>
        </ul>

      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>Payout scheme</h3>

        If you complete the whole experiment (Part 1 + Part 2) you will
        receive:

        <ul>
          <li>
            a <strong>fixed reward</strong>
              of <span id="completion-fee">1</span> USD, and
          </li>

          <li>
          a <strong>variable bonus</strong> depending on the total
          number of points collected during the experiment. Every
          <span id="exchange-rate">X</span> points you will earn 1 USD.
          </li>
        </ul>

      </p>
