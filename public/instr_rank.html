        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        You just became part of a community of <strong>9</strong> painters (including you).
        The community will collectively decide which paintings can be
        displayed in <strong>3</strong> artistic exhibitions: <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, and <em>C</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
      Always keep in mind: In this game you will act both as an <em>artist</em> and as an <em>art critic</em>.
      </p>

      <h3>The game</h3>

      The game is repeated <strong id="ng_replace_repeat"></strong>
      rounds. Each round is divided in 4 steps:

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Each artist creates 1 painting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 2: </strong>Each artist chooses 1 exhibition to which he / she submits the work of art.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Step 3: </strong>Each artist reviews 3 of the 8 paintings produced by the other artists.
          The review is done by assigning a score on a scale from 0 to 10.
          </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Step 4: </strong> The best paintings are displayed
          in the exhibition to which they have been submitted, and
          generate a reward points for the author. The rules are
          explained below.
