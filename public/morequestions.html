      B (medium)
      − I was choosing the exhibition where my drawing would fit best in term of style (as
      compared to past drawings)
      − I was choosing the exhibition solely based on the expected reward.
      
      Which criteria were you following for reviewing an image?
      − I was considering the exhibition I was reviewing for. I was stricter for images
      submitted to A, less strict for B, and even less for C
      − I was giving higher scores to images that I liked the most
      − I was giving higher scores to images that were more diverse/unique
      − I was selecting if an image was fitting the style of the selected exhibition.
      − I was giving lower scores to images submitting in my same exhibition.
      − I was giving lower scores to images submitting in my same exhibition, but only for A
      − I was giving lower scores to images submitting in my same exhibition, but only for B
      − I was giving lower scores to images submitting in my same exhibition, but only for C
      − Others, specify
      
      Under which conditions did you copy an image from **other** participants?
      − I did not do copy any
      − Because I liked it and I thought I could improve my style
      − Because I thought that submitting a variation of that image would increase my
      chances of winning
      − Other, explain
      
      Under which conditions did you copy a past image of your **own**?
      − I did not do copy any
      − To save time in changing style
      − I was running out of new ideas
      − I thought that bringing back an old image would be successful
      − Other, explain
      
      Did you think one or more exhibition developed an own style during the game? If so,
      which one (you can select more) A,B,C [Explain more if you like]
